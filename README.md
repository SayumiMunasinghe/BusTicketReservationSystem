# BusTicketReservationSystem
A group project for Year 2 Semester 1 - Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Module, where me and my teammates built a Online Bus Ticket Reservation System.

## Function
This system handles the passengers and bus agencies functionalities. On the passengers view, the user can register, then login themselves and search for available buses based on the departing and arriving bus stops and the date of travel. The bus agencies can similarly register and login themselves. They are allowed to add buses under their agency account, and add the schedules of the bus and other relevant information.

### My Contribution
* Created the login and registration for the passenger
* Allow passenger to update contact number and password
* Allow user to delete their account
